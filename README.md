# King County House Sales 
First project during my Data Science Bootcamp. I worked with the King County House Sales dataset. 
Here, the focus is on EDA, Linear Regression and the Data Science Lifecycle.

On the one hand, the goal was to extract recommendations for action for home sellers, such as real estate agents, from the EDA. 
On the other hand, the sales price should be predicted with the help of a linear regression model.
